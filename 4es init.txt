a person with a phone in front of a tv 

things evolved: some of our ideas evolved bla bla 

we have two sets of devices: smart devices in homes (raps pi) -> smart TV core

you can stick it to the TV

or you can use it for home automation / expansion boards / blabla 

we reavhed what Java wanted to reach 10 years ago - a coffee-connected Internet machine 

mobile phone is an identification device; every member of a family has his own mob phone; we can think of microsocial applications -> family-based

smart devices that can be connected to the internet; each member of the family has his own phone; depending on the place he/she pays in the family; how do we brindge them and how do they interact

the phone is identification and kakaia-ta hernea also 

moving content from a phone to a screen

via cloud services 

if you can think of any idea of a system where you have a cloud services (all the cloud at your feet) -> every smart device can be plugged in and it will display tweets, it also has to know who is using it 

it's about a family and a system where you have 1+ smart devices and 1+ phones connected to cloud devices; identification; phones have devices; GPS for tracking; etc
